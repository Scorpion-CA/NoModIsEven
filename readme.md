This was something I decided to make in my spare time at college when I was bored between classes, it took me an hour and a half, 2 minutes of which was the actual isEven functions and most of which was having fun making the util functions and practising good coding practises like commenting, error checking, and input validation, might continue it at some point to see how many util functions I can jam into a simple project
