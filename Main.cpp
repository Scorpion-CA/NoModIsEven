        Some different methods to check if a number is even without using a modulus operator, with some added bonus util functions that were fun to make, like charToInt(), intToChar()
    and callMethod(), all made using only built in library functions other than iostream because I may have overcomplicated this but I'm sure not making my own console window
    and data streaming system for it, as fun as that sounds. Mainly did this to practise good habits like commenting code and error checking/input validation

        Like anyone would want to steal this anyway, and I guarentee many others have done something like the methods in here, the hardest things in here were the charToInt(), 
    intToChar(), and the callMethod(), those are pretty much the only reasons this is going on github, on top of someone telling me to just throw everything on there because it's
    a good habit, also used this to practise commenting my code, because when I learned, I never learned to comment my code because I was self-taught and it's been a really
    tricky habit to break. Anyway, rant over.
